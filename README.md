# JavaScript Quiz

## Description

This Javascript Quiz was created to test the users general JavaScript knowledge. This project really forced me to take a step back and view the core concepts being used here carefully. I learned the importance of creating variables and making sure you give proper names to them so you can reference at a later time much easier.
